    <h3>Pizza Crust Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C) </li>
      <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast </li>
      <li>1 teaspoon white sugar </li>
      <li>2 ½ cups bread flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li> 1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to Roll Out Pizza Dough</h3>
    <p>Stretching pizza dough is the most hands-on part of the pizza crust-making process. It takes a little practice, but it's as easy as pie (pun intended). To shape the dough: </p>
   <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), and lightly grease a pizza pan.</li>
    <li>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. </li>
    <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier. </li>
    <li>Let rest for 5 minutes. </li>
    <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.</li>
    <li>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan. </li>
    <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice. </li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving. </li>
   </ol>
   
    <h3>Let the Dough Come to Room Temperature </h3>
   <p>After you're finished mixing the ingredients, allow your dough to rest on the counter for about 5 minutes. This will allow the gluten to relax, making the dough much easier to stretch and shape. </p>
   <h3>Prepare Your Surface With Oil </h3>
   <p>You might feel inclined to prep your workspace with a big handful of flour to prevent sticking. This is a helpful step with many kinds of dough. However, in this case, too much flour can make your pizza crust tough. Instead, rub your surface (and your hands) with a few tablespoons of olive oil and maybe a little bit of flour. This will prevent sticking, encourage a crispy texture, and ensure a gorgeous golden color. </p>
   <h3>Shape the Dough</h3>
   <p>You have a few options when it comes to shaping the dough. Stretch it in the air, use a rolling pin, or pat it with your hands. No matter which method you choose, make sure not to overwork the dough. Working it too much will create a tough texture. When you're done, you should have an even circle that's about 10 to 12 inches wide and about ⅓-inch thick. If you get too thin, the crust may not be able to support the sauce and toppings. </p>
